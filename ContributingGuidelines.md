## Code of conduct

This project is governed by its [Code of Conduct](CodeOfConduct.md). By participating, you're expected to uphold this code.


## Questions?

For questions and discussions, use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ccipd/MRQy/issues).

You should also check out [the wiki](https://github.com/ccipd/MRQy/wiki).


## How can I contribute?

### Citing MRQy

If you use MRQy in your research, please **cite the paper**:

_Sadri, AR, Janowczyk, A, Zou, R, Verma, R, Antunes, J, Madabhushi, A, Tiwari, P, Viswanath, SE, "MRQy: An Open-Source Tool for Quality Control of MR Imaging Data", https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04871, 2020_ [[Link]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04871)

Writing and supporting such tools take _a lot_ of time. So whenever you use any software for research, please remember to check how it should be cited!


### Reporting bugs

If you find a bug, you can report it [here](https://github.com/ccipd/MRQy/issues).

### Supporting others

#### Answering questions
The issue tracker isn't just a good place for asking questions - it's a good place for answering them too.

It's _enormously helpful_ when users of the software answer one another's questions rather than leaving it up to the developer... and it's a good way to learn as well.

#### Creating documentation
Figured out how to do something, and want to spare others the time it took?

Tutorials, tweetorials, blog posts and videos can all help add to the community documentation. [Wiki entries](https://github.com/ccipd/MRQy/wiki) and blog posts help spread the love!


### Suggesting enhancements

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/ccipd/MRQy/issues) is also a good place to suggest enhancements to MRQy

Please be aware that there are enhancements planned already - you should vote or comment on any suggestions or feedback you have.


### Working together

MRQy is being developed at Case Westen Reserve University. 
Ways to contribute (other than forking this repository) include [joining Satish's group](https://engineering.case.edu/groups/inventlab/), as well as collaborating on research projects and methods that can be integrated back into MRQy for everyone to use.

Contact Satish at satish.viswanath@case.edu if you are interested in further discussions!

### Writing code

#### Pull requests

You can also contribute by submitting pull requests to MRQy itself.

It would be _much appreciated_ if you discuss any proposed changes first [the issue tracker](https://github.com/ccipd/MRQy/issues). It may be that someone is already working on what you'd like to change, or it might not be compatible with some other work-in-progress.

In accordance with [GitHub's Terms of Service](https://help.github.com/en/articles/github-terms-of-service#6-contributions-under-repository-license), any contributions you _do_ make are under the [same license as MRQy](LICENSE.md). Please make sure you have the rights for any code that you contribute, and you attribute any dependencies appropriately.

These guidelines were adapted from [QuPath](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
